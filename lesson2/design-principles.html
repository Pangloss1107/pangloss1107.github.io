                <p>Intendencia de Montevideo</p>

                <a href="https://montevideo.gub.uy/tramites-y-servicios">intendenciademontevideo</a>

                <p>This website belongs to a state organization. Several important 
                    procedures are carried out there, and most Uruguayans (or all)
                    have physically gone at some point to carry out some procedure 
                    there.<br> Currently, there are many procedures that can be managed 
                    through the website, which means that the user does not have to 
                    leave the comfort of their home to do so.<br>
                    As there are a variety of people of different ages who have to 
                    carry out the procedures, it is important that the website is 
                    accessible to all of them.<br>
                    I consider that the principle of Accessibility was correctly 
                    applied, since I believe that all the people who access this 
                    page will know where to go to find what they are looking for.</p>

            <h3 class="titles">Repetition</h3>

            <p>HBO Max</p>

            <a href="https://www.hbomax.com/uy/es?pid=HBOMax.com&af_channel=Referral&c=Navigation">hbomax</a>

            <div class="image2"><img src="/lesson2/images/hbo.png" alt="Intendencia_img.jpg"></div> 

            <p>In this HBO Max website, we can see that in addition to the responsive design principle, 
                the repetition principle is used.<br> When browsing the page, we find that the same style of buttons, 
                styles, fonts, navigation structure and colors are repeated.<br>
                What is sought when applying this principle is that the user who enters the page feels more familiar 
                with the website as he explores it.

            <p>W3Schools</p>

            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a>

            <div class="image3"><img src="/lesson2/images/w3schools.png" alt="Intendencia_img.jpg"></div> 

            <p>This is one of the websites I use the most when learning a new programming language, 
                or when I'm stuck on something and need answers. <br>Most of the time I access this 
                website from my notebook, but when I'm in another place and a question arises, or I 
                just want to learn how to do something, I use my cell phone. <br>
                Personally, I think it is very important that a website like this applies the 
                "Responsive" design principle because it allows any user who needs to use it to 
                have a great experience doing so. <br>
                Since it will not be difficult for the person to navigate the website from any device.</p>
